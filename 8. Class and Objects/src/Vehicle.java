/**

 # Constructors in Java :
    A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated (created)
    from a class. It is used to initialize the object's state
    (assign values to the objectâ€™s fields).

    Characteristics of Constructors:
        * Name: A constructor must have the same name as the class.

        * No Return Type: It does not return a value, not even void.

        * Automatic Invocation: It is automatically invoked when a new object is
                                using the new keyword.

        * Types:

            -Default Constructor: If no constructor is provided, Java supplies a default
                constructor that initializes object fields to default values (e.g., 0, null).

            -Parameterized Constructor: You can define constructors that accept parameters
                                        to initialize the object with custom values.

            It is mainly used to:

            * Differentiate between instance variables and parameters when they have
              the same name.

            * Invoke other constructors within the same class.

            * Return the current instance from a method.
